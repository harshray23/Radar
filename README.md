This project is a radar simulation system built using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, a servo motor, and an Arduino UNO. The system scans a 150Â° area by rotating the sensor using the servo, measuring distances to nearby objects. The data is sent via Serial, which can later be visualized using Processing or any GUI interface.
